# fhir-converter
Converts from an SGO and a VCF file to the FHIR Genomics standard (json).

## current version (1.2)
Takes in a Sequence Graph Output file (.sgo) and the corresponding Vector Call Format (.vcf) file.
Converts the variations present into FHIR json files.

The code at the moment is not very clean, but it works as expected.
